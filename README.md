Propulsion provides a granular suite of .NET NuGet packages for building Reactive event processing pipelines. It caters for:

- **Event Sourcing Reactions**: Handling projections and reactions based on event feeds from stores such as EventStoreDB and the Equinox Stores (DynamoStore, CosmosStore, MemoryStore)
- **Generic Ingestion and Publishing pipelines**: The same abstractions can also be used for consuming and/or publishing to any target.
- **Serverless event pipelines**: The core components do not assume a long-lived process.
  The `DynamoStore`-related components implement support for running an end-to-end event sourced system on Amazon DynamoDB and Lambda.
- **Unit and Integration testing support**: The `AwaitCompletion` mechanisms in `MemoryStore` and `FeedSource` provide a clean way to structure test suites in a manner that achieves good test coverage without flaky tests or slow tests.
- **Strong metrics support**: Feed Sources and Projectors provide comprehensive logging and metrics. At present, the primary integration is with Prometheus.

If you're looking for a good discussion forum on these kinds of topics, look no further than the [DDD-CQRS-ES Discord](https://github.com/ddd-cqrs-es/community)'s [#equinox channel](https://discord.com/channels/514783899440775168/1002635005429825657) ([invite link](https://discord.gg/sEZGSHNNbH)).

## Core Components

- `Propulsion` [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Propulsion.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Propulsion/) Implements core functionality in a channel-independent fashion. [Depends](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Propulsion) on `MathNet.Numerics`, `Serilog`

    1. `StreamsProjector`: High performance pipeline that handles parallelized event processing. Ingestion of events, and checkpointing of progress are handled asynchronously. Each aspect of the pipeline is decoupled such that it can be customized as desired, with good testing support. 
    2. `Streams.Prometheus`: Helper that exposes per-scheduler metrics for Prometheus scraping.
    3. `ParallelProjector`: Scaled down variant of `StreamsProjector` that does not preserve stream level ordering semantics

- `Propulsion.Feed` [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Propulsion.Feed.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Propulsion.Feed/) Provides helpers for streamwise consumption of a feed of information with an arbitrary interface (e.g. a third-party Feed API), including the maintenance of checkpoints referencing such a feed. [Depends](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Propulsion.Feed) on `Propulsion`, a `IFeedCheckpointStore` implementation (from e.g., `Propulsion.CosmosStore` or `Propulsion.DynamoStore`)

    1. `FeedSource`: Handles continual reading and checkpointing of events from a set of feeds ('tranches' of a 'source') that collectively represent a change data capture source from a given system (roughly analogous to how a CosmosDB Container presents a changefeed). A `readTranches` function is expected to yield a `TrancheId` list; the Feed Source operates a logical reader thread per such tranche. Each individual Tranche is required to be able to represent its content as an incrementally retrievable change feed with a monotonically increasing `Index` per `FsCodec.ITimelineEvent` read from a given tranche.
    2. `Monitor.AwaitCompletion`: Enables efficient waiting for completion of reaction processing within an integration test
    3. `PeriodicSource`: Handles regular crawling of an external datasource (such as a SQL database) where there is no way to isolate the changes since a given checkpoint (based on either the intrinsic properties of the data, or of the store itself). The source is expected to present its content as an `AsyncSeq` of `FsCodec.StreamName * FsCodec.IEventData * context`. Checkpointing occurs only when all events have been completely ingested by the Sink.
    4. `Prometheus`: Exposes reading statistics to Prometheus (including metrics from `DynamoStore.DynamoStoreSource`, `EventStoreDb.EventStoreSource` and `SqlStreamStore.SqlStreamStoreSource`)

- `Propulsion.MemoryStore` [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Propulsion.MemoryStore.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Propulsion.MemoryStore/). Provides bindings to `Equinox.MemoryStore`. [Depends](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Propulsion.MemoryStore) on `Equinox.MemoryStore` v `4.0.0`, `FsCodec.Box`, `Propulsion`

    1. `MemoryStoreSource`: Forwards from an `Equinox.MemoryStore` into a `Propulsion.Sink`, in order to enable maximum efficiency integration testing.
    2. `Monitor.AwaitCompletion`: Enables efficient **deterministic** waits for Reaction processing within integration or unit tests.
    3. `ReaderCheckpoint`: ephemeral checkpoint storage for `Propulsion.DynamoStore`/`Feed`/`EventStoreDb`/`SqlStreamSteamStore` in test contexts.

# Overview

## The Equinox Perspective

Propulsion and Equinox have a [Yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) relationship; the use cases for both naturally interlock and overlap.

See [the Equinox Documentation's Overview Diagrams](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#overview) for the perspective from the other side (TL;DR the same topology, with elements that are de-emphasized here central over there, and vice versa)

## [C4](https://c4model.com) Context diagram

While Equinox focuses on the **Consistent Processing** element of building an event-sourced decision processing system, offering tailored components that interact with a specific **Consistent Event Store**, Propulsion elements support the building of complementary facilities as part of an overall Application. Conceptually one can group such processing based on high level roles such as:

- **Ingesters**: read stuff from outside the Bounded Context of the System. This kind of service covers aspects such as feeding reference data into **Read Models**, ingesting changes into a consistent model via **Consistent Processing**. _These services are not acting in reaction to events emanating from the **Consistent Event Store**, as opposed to..._
- **Publishers**: react to events as they are arrive from the **Consistent Event Store** by filtering, rendering and producing to feeds for downstreams. _While these services may in some cases rely on synchronous queries via **Consistent Processing**, they are not transacting or driving follow-on work; which brings us to..._
- **Reactors**: drive reactive actions triggered based on upstream feeds, or events observed in the **Consistent Event Store**. _These services handle anything beyond the duties of **Ingesters** or **Publishers**, and will often drive follow-on processing via Process Managers and/or transacting via **Consistent Processing**. In some cases, a reactor app's function may be to progressively compose a notification for a **Publisher** to eventually publish._

The overall territory is laid out here in this [C4](https://c4model.com) System Context Diagram:

<!-- ## [C4](https://c4model.com) Container diagram

The relevant pieces of the above break down as follows, when we emphasize the [Containers](https://c4model.com) aspects relevant to Propulsion:

 -->

**[See Overview section in `DOCUMENTATION`.md for further drill down](https://github.com/jet/propulsion/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#overview)**

## QuickStart

### 1. Use `propulsion` tool to run a CosmosDb ChangeFeedProcessor or DynamoStoreSource projector

```powershell
dotnet tool uninstall Propulsion.Tool -g
dotnet tool install Propulsion.Tool -g

propulsion init -ru 400 cosmos # generates a -aux container for the ChangeFeedProcessor to maintain consumer group progress within
# -V for verbose ChangeFeedProcessor logging
# `-g projector1` represents the consumer group - >=1 are allowed, allowing multiple independent projections to run concurrently
# stats specifies one only wants stats regarding items (other options include `kafka` to project to Kafka)
# cosmos specifies source overrides (using defaults in step 1 in this instance)
propulsion -V project -g projector1 stats cosmos

# load events with 2 parallel readers, detailed store logging and a read timeout of 20s
propulsion -VS project -g projector1 stats dynamo -rt 20 -d 2
```

### 2. Use `propulsion` tool to Run a CosmosDb ChangeFeedProcessor or DynamoStoreSource projector, emitting to a Kafka topic 

```powershell
$env:PROPULSION_KAFKA_BROKER="instance.kafka.mysite.com:9092" # or use -b

# `-V` for verbose logging
# `-g projector3` represents the consumer group; >=1 are allowed, allowing multiple independent projections to run concurrently
# `-l 5` to report ChangeFeed lags every 5 minutes
# `kafka` specifies one wants to emit to Kafka
# `temp-topic` is the topic to emit to
# `cosmos` specifies source overrides (using defaults in step 1 in this instance)
propulsion -V project -g projector3 -l 5 kafka temp-topic cosmos
```

### 3. Use `propulsion` tool to inspect DynamoStoreSource Index

Summarize current state of the index being prepared by `Propulsion.DynamoStore.Indexer`

    propulsion index dynamo -t equinox-test

Example output:

    19:15:50 I Current Tranches / Active Epochs [[0, 354], [2, 15], [3, 13], [4, 13], [5, 13], [6, 64], [7, 53], [8, 53], [9, 60]]  
    19:15:50 I Inspect Index Tranches list events 👉 eqx -C dump '$AppendsIndex-0' dynamo -t equinox-test-index  
    19:15:50 I Inspect Batches in Epoch 2 of Index Tranche 0 👉 eqx -C dump '$AppendsEpoch-0_2' -B dynamo -t equinox-test-index

### 4. Use `propulsion` tool to validate DynamoStoreSource Index  

Validate `Propulsion.DynamoStore.Indexer` has not missed any events (normally you guarantee this by having alerting on Lambda failures) 
 
    propulsion index -t 0 dynamo -t equinox-test

### 5. Use `propulsion` tool to reindex and/or add missing notifications

In addition to being able to validate the index (see preceding step), the tool facilitates ingestion of missing events from a complete [DynamoDB JSON Export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataExport.html). Steps are as follows:

0. Enable Point in Time Restores in DynamoDB
1. Export data to S3, download and extract JSON from `.json.gz` files
2. Run ingestion job    

       propulsion index -t 0 $HOME/Downloads/DynamoDbS3Export/*.json dynamo -t equinox-test

## TEMPLATES

The best place to start, sample-wise is with the [QuickStart](#quickstart), which walks you through sample code, tuned for approachability, from `dotnet new` templates stored [in a dedicated repo](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates).

## BUILDING

Please note the [QuickStart](#quickstart) is probably the best way to gain an overview, and the templates are the best way to see how to consume it; these instructions are intended mainly for people looking to make changes. 

NB The `Propulsion.Kafka.Integration` tests are reliant on a `TEST_KAFKA_BROKER` environment variable pointing to a Broker that has been configured to auto-create ephemeral Kafka Topics as required by the tests (each test run blindly writes to a guid-named topic and trusts the broker will accept the write without any initialization step)

### build, including tests

```powershell
dotnet build build.proj -v n
```

## FAQ

<a name="why-not-cfp-all-the-things"></a>
### Why do you employ Kafka as an additional layer, when downstream processes could simply subscribe directly and individually to the relevant CosmosDB change feed(s)? Is it to accommodate other messages besides those emitted from events and snapshot updates? :pray: [@Roland Andrag](https://github.com/randrag)

Well, Kafka is definitely not a critical component or a panacea.

You're correct that the bulk of things that can be achieved using Kafka can be accomplished via usage of the ChangeFeed. One thing to point out is that in the context of enterprise systems, having a well maintained Kafka cluster does have less incremental cost that it might do if you're building a smaller system from nothing.

Some of the negatives of consuming from the CF direct:

- each CFP reader imposes RU charges (its a set of continuous queries against each and every physical range of which the Cosmos Container is composed)
- you can't apply a server-side filter, so you pay to see the full content of any document that's touched
- there's an elevated risk of implementation shortcuts that couple the reaction logic to low level specifics of the store or the data structures 
- (as you alluded to), if there's some logic or work involved in the production of events you'd emit to Kafka, each consumer would need to duplicate that

While many of these concerns can be alleviated to varying degrees by splitting the storage up into multiple Containers such that each consumer will intrinsically be interested in a large proportion of the data it will observe (potentially using database level RU allocations), the write amplification effects of having multiple consumers will always be more significant when reading directly than when using Kafka,  the design of which is well suited to running lots of concurrent readers.

Splitting event categories into Containers solely to optimize these effects can also make the management of the transactional workload more complex; the ideal for any given Container is to balance the concerns of:

- ensuring that datasets for which you want to ringfence availability / RU allocations don't share with containers/databases for which running hot (potentially significant levels of rate limiting but overall high throughput in aggregate as a result of using a high percentage of the allocated capacity)
- avoiding prematurely splitting data prior to it being required by the constraints of CosmosDB (i.e. you want to let splitting primarily be driven by reaching the [10GB] physical partition range)
- not having logical partition hotspots that lead to a small number of physical partitions having significantly above average RU consumption
- having relatively consistent document sizes
- economies of scale - if each container (or database if you provision at that level) needs to be individually managed (with a degree of headroom to ensure availability for load spikes etc), you'll tend to require higher aggregate RU assignment for a given overall workload based on a topology that has more containers

### Any tips for testing Propulsion (projection) in an integration/end-to-end fashion? :pray: [@James Booth](https://github.com/absolutejam)

> I know for unit testing, I can just test the obvious parts. Or if end to end testing is even required

Depends what you want to achieve. One important technique for doing end-to-end scenarios, especially where some reaction is supposed to feed back into Equinox is to use `Equinox.MemoryStore` as the store, and then wire Propulsion to consume from that using `Propulsion.MemoryStore.MemoryStoreProjector`. 

Other techniques I've seen/heard are:
- rig things to use ephemeral ESDB or Cosmos databases (the CosmosDB emulator works but has restrictions; perhaps you can use serverless or database level RU allocated DBs in a shared environment) to run your system against an ephemeral store.
- Once you have a store, the next question is how to validate your projector (Publisher / Reactor) apps. In some cases, people opt to spin up a large subset of the production system (maybe in docker-compose etc) and then check for externally visible effects in tests.
- While it's important to do end-to-end tests with as much of the whole system as possible, that does tend to make for a messy test suite that quickly becomes unmaintainable. In general, the solution is to do smaller test scenarios that achieve that same goal by triangulating on subsets of the overall reactions as smaller scenarios. See the `Shipping.Watchdog.Integration` test suite in the `equinox-shipping` template for an example.

In general I'd be looking to use `MemoryStoreProjector` as a default technique, as it provides:
- the best performance by far (all synchronous and in-memory, without any simulators)
- a deterministic wait mechanism; after arranging a particular system state, you can pause until a reaction has been processed by using the projector's `AwaitCompletion` facility to efficiently wait for the exact moment at which the event has been handled by the reactor component without padded Sleep seqences (or, worse, retry loops).   

To answer more completely, I'd say given a scenario involving Propulsion and Equinox, you'll typically have the following ingredients:

1. writing to the store - you can either assume that's well-tested infra or say you want to know you wired it up properly
2. serialization/deserialization - you can either have unit tests and/or property tests to validate roundtripping as an orthogonal concern, or you can take the view that it's critical to know it really works with real data
3. reading from feed, propagating to handler - that's harder to config and has the biggest variability in a test scenario so either:

   - you want to take it out of the equation
   - OR you want to know its wired properly
  
4. does handler work complete cleanly - yes you can and should unit test that, but maybe you want to know it works end-to-end with a much larger proportion of the overall system in play

5. does it trigger follow-on work, i.e. a cascade of reactions. You can either do triangulation and say its proven if I observe the trigger for the next bit, or you can want to prove it end to end

6. does the entire system as a whole really work - sometimes you want to be able to validate workflows rather than having to pay the tax of going in the front door for every aspect (though you'll typically want to have a meaningful set of smoke tests that validate basic system integrity without requiring manual testing) 

### Any reason you didn’t use one of the different subscription models available in ESDB? :pray: [@James Booth](https://github.com/absolutejam)

#### TL;DR Differing goals

While the implementation and patterns in Propulsion happen to overlap to a degree with the use cases of the ESDB's subscription mechanisms, the main reason they are not used directly stems from the needs and constraints that Propulsion was evolved to cover. 

One thing that should be clear is that Propulsion is definitely *not* solving for the need of being the simplest conceivable projection library with a low concept count that's easy to get started with. If you're looking to build such a library, you'll likely give yourself some important guiding non-goals, e.g., if you had to add 3 concepts to get a 50% improvement in throughput, whether or not that's worth it depends on the context.

For Propulsion, almost literally, job one was to be able to shift 1TB of ordered events in streams to/from ESDB/Cosmos/Kafka in well under 24h - a naive implementation reading and writing in small batches takes more like 24d to do the same thing. A secondary goal is to keep them in sync continually after that point (it's definitely more than a one time bulk ingestion system).

While Propulsion scales down to running simple subscriptions, its got quite a few additional concepts compared to using something built literally for that exact job; the general case of arbitrary projections was almost literally an afterthought.

That's not to say that Propulsion's concepts make for a more complex system when all is said and done; there are lots of scenarios where you avoid having to do concurrent/async tricks one might otherwise do more explicitly in a more basic subscription system.

When looking at the vast majority of typical projections/reactions/denormalizers one runs in an event-sourced system it should come as no surprise that EventStoreDB's subscription features offer lots of excellent ways of achieving those common goals with a good balance of:
- time to implement
- ease of operation
- good enough performance

_That's literally the company's goal: enabling rapidly building systems to solve business problems without overfitting to any specific industry or application's needs_. 

The potential upsides that Propulsion can offer when used as a projection system can definitely be valuable _when actually needed_, but on average, they'll equally they can be overkill for a given specific requirement.

With that context set, here are some notable aspects of using Propulsion for Projectors rather than building a minimal bespoke wiring on a case by case basis:
- similar APIs regardless of whether events arrive via CosmosDB, DynamoDB, EventStoreDB or Kafka etc
- consistent dashboards across all those sources
- generally excellent performance for high throughput scenarios (it was built for that)
- good handling for processing of workloads that don't have uniform (and low) cost per handler invocation, i.e., rate-limited writes of events to `Equinox.CosmosStore` (compared to e.g. using a store such as Redis)
- orthogonality to Equinox features but still offering a degree of commonality of concepts and terminology
- provide a degree of isolation from the low level drivers, e.g.:
  - moving from the deprecated Cosmos CFP V2 to any future `Azure.Cosmos` V4 SDK will be a matter of changing package references and fixing some minimal compilation errors, as opposed to learning a whole new API set
  - moving from EventStore's TCP API / EventStore.Client to the gRPC based >= v20 clients is a package switch
  - migrating a workload from EventStoreDB to CosmosDB or vice versa can be accomplished more cleanly if you're only changing the wiring of your projector host while making no changes to the handler implementations 
  - SqlStreamStore fits logically in as well; using it gives a cleaner mix and match / onramp to/from ESDB (Note however that migrating SSS <-> ESDB is a relatively trivial operation vs migrating from raw EventStore usage to Equinox.CosmosStore, i.e. "we're using Propulsion to isolate us from deciding between SSS or ESDB" is not a good enough reason on its own)
- Specifically when consuming from CosmosDB, being able to do that over a longer wire by feeding to Kafka to limit RU consumption from projections is a relatively minor change.

#### A Brief History of Propulsion's feature set

The order in which the need for various components arose (as a side effect of building out [Equinox](https://github.com/jet/equinox); solving specific needs in terms of feeding events into and out of EventStoreDB, CosmosDB and Kafka) was also an influence on the abstractions within and general facilities of Propulsion.

  - `Propulsion.Cosmos`'s `Source` was the first bit done; it's a light wrapper over the [CFP V2 client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-changefeedprocessor-dotnet). Key implications from that are:
    - order of events in a logical partition can and should be maintained
    - global ordering of events across all logical streams is not achievable due to how CosmosDB works (the only ordering guarantees are at logical partition level, the data can physically split at any time as data grows)
  - `Propulsion.Kafka`'s `Sink` was next; the central goal here is be able to replicate events being read from CosmosDB onto a Kafka Topic _maintaining the ordering guarantees_. Implications:
    - There are two high level ways of achieving ordering guarantees in Kafka:
       1. only ever have a single event in flight; only when you've got the ack for a write do you send the next one. *However, literally doing that compromises throughput massively*.
       2. use Kafka's transaction facilities (not implemented in `Confluent.Kafka` at the time)
    => The approach used is to continuously emit messages concurrently in order to maintain throughput, but guarantee to never emit messages for the same _key_ at the same time.
  - `Propulsion.Cosmos`'s `Sink` was next up. It writes to CosmosDB using `Equinox.CosmosStore`. Key implications:  
    - because rate-limiting is at the physical partition level, it's crucial for throughput that you keep other partitions busy while wait/retry loops are triggered by hotspots (and you absolutely don't want to exacerbate this effect by competing with yourself)
    - you want to batch the writing of multiple events/documents to minimize round-trips (write RU costs are effectively _O(log N)_ despite high level guidance characterizing it as _O(N)_))
    - you can only touch one logical partition for any given write (CosmosDB does not expose transactions across logical partitions)
    - when you hit a hotspot and need to retry, ideally you'd pack events queued as the last attempt was being executed into the retry attempt
    - there is no one-size fits all batch size ([yet](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/issues/1763)) that balances

      1. not overloading the source and
      2. maintaining throughput
       
      You'll often need a small batch size, which implies larger per-event checkpointing overhead unless you make the checkpointing asynchronous

      The implementation thus:
        - manages reading async from writing in order to maintain throughput (you define a batch size _and_ a number of batches to read ahead)
        - schedules write attempts at stream level (the reader concurrently ingests successor events, making all buffered events available when retrying)
        - writes checkpoints asynchronously as and when all the items involved complete within the (stream-level) processing
  - At the point where `Propulsion.EventStore`'s `Source` and `Sink` were being implemented (within weeks of the `CosmosStore` equivalents; largely overlapping), the implications from realizing goals of providing good throughput while avoiding adding new concepts if it can be avoided are:
    - The cheapest (lowest impact in terms of triggering scattered reads across disks on an ESDB server, with associated latency implications) and most general API set for reading events is to read the `$all` stream
    - Maintaining checkpoints in an EventStoreDB that you're also monitoring is prone to feedback effects (so using the Async checkpointing strategy used for `.CosmosStore` but saving them in an external store such as an `Equinox.CosmosStore`  makes sense)
    - If handlers and/or sinks don't have uniform processing time per message and/or are subject to rate limiting, most of the constraints of the `CosmosSStoreink` apply too; you don't want to sit around retrying the last request out of a batch of 100 while tens of thousands of provisioned RUs are sitting idle in Cosmos and throughput is stalled

#### Conclusion/comparison checklist

The things Propulsion in general accomplishes in the projections space:
- Uniform dashboards for throughput, successes vs failures, and latency distributions over CosmosDB, DynamoDB, EventStoreDB, Kafka and generic Feeds
- Metrics to support trustworthy alerting and detailed analysis of busy, failing and stuck projections
- reading, checkpointing, parsing and running handlers are all independent asynchronous activities
- enable handlers to handle backlog of accumulated items for a stream as a batch if desired
- maximize concurrency across streams
- (for CosmosDB, but could be achieved for EventStoreDB) provides for running multiple instances of consumers leasing physical partitions roughly how Kafka does it (aka the ChangeFeedProcessor lease management - Propulsion just wraps that and does not seek to impose any significant semantics on top of it)
- provide good instrumentation as to latency, errors, throughput in a pluggable way akin to how Equinox does stuff (e.g. it has built-in Prometheus support)
- good stories for isolating from specific drivers - i.e., there's `Propulsion.Cosmos` (using the V2 SDK) and a `Propulsion.CosmosStore` (for the V3 SDK) with close-to-identical interfaces (Similarly there's a `Propulsion.EventStoreDb` using the gRPC-based SDKs, replacing the deprecated `Propulsion.EventStore`)
- handlers/reactors/the projections can be ported from `Propulsion.Cosmos` to `Propulsion.CosmosStore` by swapping driver modules; similar to how `Equinox.Cosmos` vs `Equinox.EventStore` provides a common programming model despite the underpinnings being fundamentally quite different in nature
- Kafka reading and writing generally fits within the same patterns - i.e. if you want to push CosmosDb CFP output to Kafka and consume over that as a 'longer wire' without placing extra load on the source if you have 50 consumers, you can stand up a ~250 line `dotnet new proProjector` app, and tweak the ~30 lines of consumer app wireup to connect to Kafka instead of CosmosDB

Things EventStoreDB's subscriptions can do that are not covered in Propulsion:
- `$et-`, `$ec-` streams
- honoring the full `$all` order
- and more; EventStoreDB is a well designed purpose-built solution catering for diverse system sizes and industries
